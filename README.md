# Open-Source Economics and the Unicorn Application
Open-Source Economics (OSE) will provide exceptional financial platforms for middle-to-lower income families to assist in building wealth absent of generational support. 

Utilizing the principles of blockchain to build open-source economic services, we can create value that can be exchanged between users and providers in a way that is mutually beneficial.  This builds a unique partnership that will create growing value in the areas of new property procurements, product development and/or services. The goal of OSE is to build open-source communities that specifically create opportunities with overwhelming growth potential through business-to-business, business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer services owned by its members.
# Our Goal
To provide tangible financial solutions to middle-to-lower income classes using open-source economics.

# Our Vision
To eradicate poverty throughout the United States with the implementation of effective OSE solutions to build self sustaining open source communities.

Using Blockchain as the foundation to build new wealth strategies aligned with our guiding principles will bring lucrative success to our members.  Benefits are distributed comprehensively across members to ensure our services address their needs.  All business activities shall be handled transparently on the XRPL to ensure the highest level of ethics is adhered to and where transactions can be easily audited.  

OSE is greatly needed within our communities.  The 2014 data released by the Census Bureau indicates that the overall poverty rate in 2013 was 14.5 percent.  This represents 45.3 million people living in poverty in 2013.  Persons considered poor are those that have family incomes below the poverty threshold.  The poverty threshold for a family of four was $23,834 in 2013.  Here are some additional Census Bureau statistics:
•	The total number of children in poverty in 2013 was 14.7 million 
•	For African American children, the poverty rate reported was 36.9 percent for 2013.  The rate for Hispanic children was 30.4 percent.  For non-Hispanic, White children the rate was 10.7 percent. 
•	Related children living in female-headed families with no spouse present had a poverty rate of 45.8 percent, 
•	In 2013, 6.3 percent of all people, or 19.9 million people, lived in deep poverty (had income below one-half the poverty threshold, or $11,917 for a family of four). 

The measure of wealth is not in the ability of consumers to purchase merchandise, this iis a false assertion.  For example, there are over one (1) billion people without access to clean water.  As a result, one of the underlying main goals of the OSE model is to accumulate real wealth for our members and their families.  The below asset strategies highlight examples to ensure financial security for our members long into the future.

•	Farming Lands
•	Specialized Real-estate purchases i.e., Resorts, Farms, 
•	Banking - No usury
•	Manufacturing

OSE programs and services solve the serious problems plaguing middle-to-lower income persons.  These offerings are only some of the opportunities that we will grow to provide  to members.  

•	Education & Training.  Build and develop free education and trade school programs that will equip members with the tools to remain competitive in an increasing global economy.

•	Employment Opportunities.  Provide employment opportunities to members willing to work in companies owned and operated by OSE Foundation. 

•	Housing Programs.  Build green open-source communities that would be available free to members (similar to property managers) willing to work in OSE companies, school systems or any related capacity that provides services and products to members.

•	Financial Programs.  Build financial security for members through asset purchases that generate revenue for the sole purpose of providing a growing number of OSE programs, services, and goods for members.

•	Community Organizing Services.  Build a robust digital network consisting of OSE members which provides them the ability to vote on asset purchases, and to request critical support services heavily needed within our urban communities.

•	Prisioner Transition Services.  Provide opportunties for prisoners released from the prison system who often require financial aid, education, training, and employment.

•	Discounted Services.  Discounts of products and services from the top companies who partner with the OSE platform.
